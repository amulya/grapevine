Today, our world is more interconnected than ever. But the more global connections form, the less personal connections develop. One way personal connections were maintained even across the world was through a pen pal system. The concept of pen pals isn't new; some  may even call it outdated. But now we've revolutionized it using the power of the Internet. Pen pals are no longer limited to students lucky enough to go to a school that supports a pen pal program. Now, anyone can get a pen pal at a moment's notice. Just click sign up to reach out to someone new today.</p>
